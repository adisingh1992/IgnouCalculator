                                        Yes, the marks and grades are directly fetched from IGNOU's database servers. 
                                        The site just calculates percentages of various assignments, theory and practical papers and represent
                                        them in an aggregate manner so that you don't have to go through the hassle manually.

                                        No, it's not an official IGNOU site and we do not make any such claims, although the data shown here
                                        is completely authentic and 100% correct as published by IGNOU on their official site.
